# Welcome to JG Reads Eloquent JS

Hello there and welcome to my repo. By way of introduction, I'm a UX Designer who's learning to code with the aim of better understanding the needs of my colleagues on the Engineering team. While I've learned about UX Design in the context of business-development, my knowledge of software-engineering is rather limited- and I'd like to bridge that gap as much as I can in order to best serve the devs on my team. 

Ultimately, my mission as a designer is to research and ideate solutions for everyone on the team. This includes sales, customer support, engineering, and of course- our end-users.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is a popular language used across different programming environments, including the web-browser, server, database, and internet of things platforms. 

According to Stack Overflow's 2019 developer survey, 67.8% code in JavaScript, although Python and Rust are the most "beloved". TypeScript is edging its way on third place as the most "loved" language, so as a variant of JavaScript with more capabilities, JS looks like it's here to stay in the long-term. 

I've heard great things about Marjin Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript (now in its 3rd edition) and wanted to challenge myself by going through the first 7 chapters of the book. My goal is to write up a summary for each chapter, while solving the problem-sets and pushing them up to Github. 

## So what's in it for you?

Maybe we can turn this into a book-club on github? We'll play be ear and find out. Enjoy!
